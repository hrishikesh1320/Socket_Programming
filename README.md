**#Socket Programming: Python Server-Client Connection**

This repository contains a basic implementation of server-client communication using Python's socket library. The setup involves a simple interaction where the client sends a string message to the server, which is then displayed on the server's console.

**Prerequisites**
To run this code, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This code was developed and tested using Python 3.7.

**Usage**

**Server**

Navigate to the server directory.
Run the server.py file using Python: python server.py
The server will start listening for incoming connections.

**Client**

Navigate to the client directory.
Run the client.py file using Python: python client.py
Follow the prompts to input the string message you want to send to the server.
The message will be sent to the server, which will display it on the console.
